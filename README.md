2. **Setting up the Database**: 
   - Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL Server.
   - Create a new database or use an existing one where you want to work with the "trans" table.
   - Execute the provided SQL code to create the "trans" table within your chosen database.

3. **Executing SQL Queries**:
   - Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL Server.
   - Open a new SQL tab and paste the desired SQL query from this project.
   - Run the SQL query to perform the specified operation on the "trans" table.
